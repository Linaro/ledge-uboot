menuconfig ASYMMETRIC_KEY_TYPE
	bool "Asymmetric (public-key cryptographic) key Support"
	help
	  This option provides support for a key type that holds the data for
	  the asymmetric keys used for public key cryptographic operations such
	  as encryption, decryption, signature generation and signature
	  verification.

if ASYMMETRIC_KEY_TYPE

config ASYMMETRIC_PUBLIC_KEY_SUBTYPE
	bool "Asymmetric public-key crypto algorithm subtype"
	help
	  This option provides support for asymmetric public key type handling.
	  If signature generation and/or verification are to be used,
	  appropriate hash algorithms (such as SHA-1) must be available.
	  ENOPKG will be reported if the requisite algorithm is unavailable.
